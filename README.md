# React.js Admin Dashboard with Ant Design

This project is an admin dashboard built using React.js and Ant Design. It was created as a learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with React.js concepts such as state management, hooks, and conditional rendering. The dashboard allows users to navigate between different sections, including inventory, customers, orders, and revenue, with real-time rendering of respective lists.

## Features

- Clickable navigation options for inventory, customers, orders, and revenue.
- Real-time rendering of data lists based on user selection.
- Utilizes Ant Design for a polished and responsive UI.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Ant Design: A design system and UI library for React.
- JSON Data Mocking: Dummy JSON data used for simulating real-time data rendering.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. Open your web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.


The project follows a simple directory structure where `Dashboard.js` serves as the main component, and individual sections like `Inventory.js`, `Customers.js`, `Orders.js`, and `Revenue.js` are conditionally rendered based on user selection.

## Learning Highlights

### State Management

- Implemented state management using React's built-in state.
- Demonstrated the use of state to control the rendering of different sections of the dashboard.

### Hooks

- Utilized React hooks such as `useState` for managing component-level state.
- Showcased how to use hooks to update the UI in response to user interactions.

### Conditional Rendering

- Employed conditional rendering to display the appropriate content based on the selected option.
- Highlighted the use of conditional logic to control the flow of the application.
